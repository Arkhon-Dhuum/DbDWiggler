# DbDWiggler
An accessibility tool to automate struggling on hook and wiggling while carried in Dead by Daylight.

This simple autohotkey script spams 'a', 'd', and spacebar while you hold down a single button. 
Download and run the pre-made wigglers set to either mouse button 5 or tilde/grave, or create your own custom script using my code!


DISCLAIMER!!   As per Behaviour:
        "It's use at your own risk. We won't actively hunt you down and ban you for it,
        but if EAC detects it and starts banning for it, we won't be able to help you." 
That said, I have been safely using this macro for many months. Easy Anti-Cheat does not detect and ban you for using a simple key-spammer, and so they shouldn't!
It doesn't provide any advantage in-game, and for many players it is an accessibility necessity.

I recommend you use the Mouse5 Wiggler and set skillchecks to Mouse4 in game.

Instructions:
Download DbDWiggler.exe 
Double click the program to run, and close it from the system tray.

Alternatively, you can place the program in your startup directory so it runs when windows starts up:
Simply cut and paste dbdwiggler.exe into your startup folder which is found by pressing Win-R and opening shell:startup

The macro will not engage until DbD is loaded. 
This prevents interference with normal mouse use (e.g. web browsing except inside the steam overlay) and lets you leave the program running.
N.B. The tilde/grave script may malfunction when that key is also bound to open the steam or discord overlay.


Customisation:
If you wish to change the hotkey used by the program, you can use the editable .ahk version. 
This version is not fully contained, so you will need to download and install AutoHotkey from www.autohotkey.com
Either download all zipped files through the download code button, or create a new text file in notepad. 
Copy the .ahk code into it, and save it as yourwigglername.ahk (with Windows view "file name extensions" enabled).
The .ahk file is run the same way as the .exe version as long as AutoHotkey is installed.
>Right click the editable.ahk file and select edit script.
>Customisation instructions are included as comments within the .ahk text file.
